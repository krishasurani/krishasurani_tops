Differentiate between append () and extend () methods? 

Append():-The append() method adds a single element to the end of a list.
        It takes one argument (the object to be added) and appends it as a single entry to the list.
        The length of the list increases by one.

example1:-list=[1,2,3,4]
         list.append(5)
         print(list)

output:-[1,2,3,4,5]

example2:-list=[1,2,3,4,5]
          list1=[6,7]
          list.append(list1)
          print(list)

output:-[1,2,3,4,5,[6,7]]

Extend():-The extend() method adds the specified list elements (or any iterable) to the end of the current list.
          It accepts an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) as its argument.
          The elements from the iterable are added individually to the end of the initial list.
          The length of the list increases by the number of elements in the iterable.

example1:-list=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
          list1=[7,8,9]
          list.extend(list1)
          print(list)

output:-[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
