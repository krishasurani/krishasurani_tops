How will you compare two lists? 

ans:- Comparing two lists in Python typically involves checking
      for equality or determining certain relationships between 
      their elements.

example1:-Check if two lists contain exactly the same elements in the same order.
        
        list1 = [1, 2, 3]
        list2 = [1, 2, 3]

        if list1 == list2:
            print("Lists are exactly equal")
        else:
            print("Lists are not equal")

example2:-Check if two lists contain the same elements, regardless of their order.

        list1 = [1, 2, 3]
        list2 = [3, 2, 1]

        if sorted(list1) == sorted(list2):
            print("Lists are equal")
        else:
            print("Lists are not equal")
